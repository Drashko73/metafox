    An abstract base class that defines the interface for a datastore.
    This class provides a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by any concrete
    datastore class. These methods cover basic CRUD operations, as well as additional
    functionalities such as retrieving AutoML job IDs and keys by pattern, and closing the
    datastore connection.
    
    Methods:
