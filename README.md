# MetaFOX

MetaFOX is an advanced automated machine learning (AutoML) component designed to simplify the initial model creation within NEMO META-OS. It automates the process of model selection, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, making it easier to develop high-quality models for federated learning (FL) and transfer learning (TL).

## Key Features

- **Model Selection**: Evaluates numerous machine learning models to find the best starting architecture for the specific problem.
- **Feature Engineering**: Automatically detects the best transformations and interactions of features that could benefit the model.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Optimizes hyperparameters efficiently, ensuring the initial model is as performant as possible.
- **Architecture Adjustments**: Determines the best architecture adjustments needed when adapting pre-trained models to new tasks.

## Getting Started

For detailed installation instructions, usage guides, and API documentation, please visit the [MetaFOX Documentation](https://metafox.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

## Prerequisites

Before running MetaFOX, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Docker**: MetaFOX relies on Docker to run its services. Follow the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.
